            <h1>Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's new bill also includes an incentive for those declaring crypto for tax purposes.</h1>
            <p class="np">Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's new bill also includes an incentive for those declaring crypto for tax purposes.<br>Crypto traders in Italy will be subject to a 26% capital-gains tax starting in 2023, according to a new budget that won parliamentary
                approval on Thursday. Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's 2023 expansionary budget - which was completed in a rush before the end of the year - features 21 billion euros ($22.3 billion) in tax breaks to assist businesses and households
                facing the energy crisis, Reuters reported.<br> Italy's (and most recently Portugal's) move to introduce a capital-gains tax on crypto comes ahead of the implementation of the European Union's Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulation
                that promises a licensing frameworks and stringent operating requirements for crypto-service providers in the 27-member bloc. The 26% rate applies to gains from crypto trading if they exceed 2,000 euros per tax period. As an incentive
                for declaring crypto profits, the new bill also sets a "substitute income tax" for investors at 14% of the value of the assets held as of Jan. 1, 2023, instead of the cost at the time of purchase.<br> According to the new rules, losses
                from crypto investments can be deducted from profits and be carried forward.<br> Investors, however, may require some additional guidance on what qualifies as a taxable event as the document also says, "the exchange between crypto assets
                having same characteristics and functions," doesn't constitute a "fiscal case."
